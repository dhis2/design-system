# Table
A table is used to display information in a standard, effective way.


## Usage
A table is a static display component. It's used to show some information that doesn't change and can't be acted upon. Consider the table a helpful utility, rather than a full-featured component.

Most use cases that need interactivity should use the [data table component](data-table.md).
