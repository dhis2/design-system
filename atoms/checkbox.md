# Checkbox
A checkbox is a control that allows a user to toggle an option.

## Usage
Checkboxes are used when an option can be toggled on or off. Toggling a checkbox on (true) is always considered a positive action and should reflect a positive/true/on state. Multiple checkboxes can be used in a list where a user can toggle multiple elements.

Do not use checkboxes in a list of several options where only a single option can be toggled, use [radio buttons](radio.md) here instead.

#### States
The checked/unchecked/disabled states of a checkbox are self-explanatory. An indeterminate state is used when some, but not all, of the child elements are selected. This state represents a middle ground between checked/unchecked.
