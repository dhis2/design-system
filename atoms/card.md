# Card
A card is a framing element that is useful as a container for grouping and separating content.

## Usage
Use a card where there is content that can be grouped together. Cards are most often useful when this grouped content may be repeated, for example with items on a dashboard. Cards have a slight elevation, so the content will appear to jump out to a user. Make sure the content is important enough to warrant this.

If there is only a single piece of content, eg. a single form on a page, it should not be placed inside a card. This could be framed with a background color instead.
